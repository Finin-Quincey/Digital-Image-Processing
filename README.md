Code for the Digital Image Processing coursework assignment (Year 4 IDE) about image filters.

The aim of this assignment was to implement and test a variety of greyscale image filters in MATLAB, with the goal of reducing noise in two different test images. Built-in image processing functions (like `conv2` and `padarray`) were not allowed - filters had to be built from sratch using only basic mathematical and matrix manipulation functions.

_The MATLAB version used was R2020b_
